# Pointer animation framework

A framework for animating 2-pointer algorithms, very crude.

## Usage
Implement your own algorithm function similar to one of the three algorithm functions already implemented. Create a folder called "snaps" in the pointeranimation directory and run the script.

Use https://ezgif.com/maker to create a gif from the exported frames.
